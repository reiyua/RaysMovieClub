# Google has decided to disable the site for supposed phishing, when its a fucking fictional movie club site, what fucking brand am I impersonating??? This is for an academic post...

# To date, Google has blocked my project a total of THREE times... I understand the first time you think it's phishing, and you were satisfied with the evidence I provided that this was for academic purposes, but you proceed to pull down my project AGAIN and AGAIN for the exact same goddamn reason.

# I do NOT care about this project any longer, Google Firebase customer support team SUCK.


## Due to Google Firebase removing access to the Cloud Storage access for non-paying users on October 1 2025, this site will no longer function as it can no longer call images for the movie listings.
## NO FURTHER SUPPORT is being provided anymore for this project. 

This GitHub repository is designed to store my Advanced Web assignment, a website hosted on Google Firebase containing React.js and its derivatives as part of my Diploma in General I.T at TAFE NSW

This website uses React.js, Bootstrap, React Bootstrap, React-DOM, React-Router-DOM and PHP and uses databases as part of the website. 

This site is now complete and has been archived, this will no longer be maintained.

There is no search component even though the website documentation specifies it as a requirement as it is incompatible with the website setup.

This website can be viewed through these services: 

Google Firebase Hosting: https://rayyan-h-tafe-nsw-2.web.app/ & https://rayyan-h-tafe-nsw-2.firebaseapp.com/ - 

GitHub Pages (Seem's to not work due to not supporting React Router): https://reiyua.github.io/RaysMovieClub/

Netlify (Seem's to not actually load anything): https://raysmovieclub.netlify.app/
