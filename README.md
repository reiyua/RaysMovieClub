# Google's Cloud team unfortunately keep taking down the hosting part of the site as they keep stating it is phishing by "stealing passwords". As a matter of fact, this site is a basic site made for an academic course. They approve it after weeks of back and forth, and eventually just take it down for the same reason.

# I do NOT care about this project any longer, Google Firebase customer support team are woeful.


## Due to Google Firebase removing access to the Cloud Storage access for non-paying users on February 2, 2026, this site will no longer function as it can no longer call images for the movie listings.
## NO FURTHER SUPPORT is being provided anymore for this project. 

This GitHub repository is designed to store my Advanced Web assignment, a website hosted on Google Firebase containing React.js and its derivatives as part of my Diploma in General I.T at TAFE NSW

This website uses React.js, Bootstrap, React Bootstrap, React-DOM and React-Router-DOM and uses databases as part of the website. 

This site is now complete and has been archived; this will no longer be maintained.

There is no search component, even though the website documentation specifies it as a requirement, as it is incompatible with the website setup.

This website can be viewed through these services: 

Google Firebase Hosting: https://rayyan-h-tafe-nsw-2.web.app/ & https://rayyan-h-tafe-nsw-2.firebaseapp.com/ - Keeps being taken down for stupid reasons.

GitHub Pages (Seems not to work due to not supporting React Router): https://reiyua.github.io/RaysMovieClub/

Netlify (Seem's to not actually load anything): https://raysmovieclub.netlify.app/
